# Checkers-AI


## How to run the code

First install Requirements

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Game

```bash
python main.py
```

**You can tweak the parameters of the game bot from [main](main.py) file**

## Conclusion

1. Heuristics can be drastically improved by adding specific features.
2. The depth of the game tree has a significant influence on the quality of the computer player.
3. There's a tradeoff between calculation time and quality of the game.
4. It is not efficient to use Minimax without optimizations while with them it can be a good solution.
5. Alpha-Beta pruning is exponentially improving in comparison to Minimax as the depth grows.
6. Certain heuristics are clearly better than others but some of the “bad” ones still work well in some cases.
